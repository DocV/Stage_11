Stage engine C++11 implementation
=======

Stage is an experiment in creating a small, proof-of-concept game engine using actor-based parallelization. Stage 11 is an alternative implementation using the built-in concurrency mechanisms of C++11 instead of actors. Stage 11 was created so that the performance of Stage could be benchmarked against an engine with identical scope and features that used a more traditional approach to parallelization. Since the engine was created for a master's thesis written at a Finnish university, all of the code comments are currently in Finnish (sorry, non-Finns!).
